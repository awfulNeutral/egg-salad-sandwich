Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have decided on using HTML over PyGame for my project, learned some basics on how to construct a webpage, and have begun creating the skeleton for the webpages necessary for my project.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I will have to learn some CSS and Java Script in order to get my project to the minimum functionality that I want, but luckily I have found some very helpful tutorials for both of those as well as HTML. I will prioritize making the webpage functional with Java Script before making it look nice with CSS.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have had to change the scope of my project slightly, and I no longer plan to keep much if any of the rules for the Kill Team game on my webpage. Instead, where necessary, I will simply link to an offical PDF of those rules.
