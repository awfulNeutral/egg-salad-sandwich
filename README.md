While I was not able to get this website to where I originally envisioned it, I'm fairly proud of what I was able to make. The largest hurdle I eventually got over was figuring out the javascript to get some functionality working. I only managed to work through a small part of that, mostly because I spent maybe a bit too much time making the everything look nice. But I did enjoy the process of making the website somewhat asthetically pleasing. Overall I enjoyed learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the process of creating webpages, but I feel that learning 3 additional programming languages and their differences in syntax was maybe biting off a bit more than I could chew for this project. I plan on continuing to work on this program, as it would be very useful to me outside of this course.

This program is to be used as a supplementary tool to the third edition of the Kill Team skirmish game by Games Workshop.

Users can select a Kill Team faction, view an image gallery of operatives from that Kill Team, and view the available weapon options for each operative.

Planned features include:
-filling out a roster of operatives
-customizing your operatives' names and weapons
-chosing and adding operatives from your roster to field in games of Kill Team
-downloading / printing PDFs of your roster and Kill Team
